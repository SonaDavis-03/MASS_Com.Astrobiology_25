programs by Data analyst Nagesh Singh Chauhan
Tasks:
• -create a new repository on your github account which name will be EXOPLANETS_ML
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo

• clone Nagesh Singh Chauhan exoplanet repo https://github.com/nageshsinghc4/Exoplanet-
exploration s into your github EXOPLANETS_ML Repo using instructions in

GITHUB_CLONE.pdf
• -when cloning is done, go to exoplanet-exploration-using-ml.ipynb and be sure to run through
the notebook; the aim is that you understand each line of the code, make printing of
intermediate results, and if unknown command is encountered than to go to the online sources
to understand its meaning
• -could you make some innovations in the ipynb such us new functions, plots, import other data
