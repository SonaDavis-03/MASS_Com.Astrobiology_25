AIMS: Simple Artificial neural network technique applied on classification of exoplanets using
programs by Data analyst Nagesh Singh Chauhan
Tasks:
• use the same reporistory as in Tutorial 3
• go to exoplanet_ANN.py and try to make ipynb of it, also take a look at article linked in repo
which may help; the aim is that you understand each line of the code, make printing of
intermediate results, and if unknown command is encountered than to go to the online sources
to understand its meaning
• -could you make some innovations in the ipynb such us new functions, plots, import other data
etc...
